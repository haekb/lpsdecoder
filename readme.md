# PS2 LPS Decoder and Extractor
Extracts and converts PS2 lithtech lps files. That's about it.

The folder structure is interesting, as it's a list with references to file starting positions, number of directories, and number of files. My current code is probably not the greatest, but it works! Feel free to improve upon it.

VGMStream does all the heavy lifting for the conversion.
